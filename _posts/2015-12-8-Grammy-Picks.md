Here are a few of my picks for the 2016 Grammys

# Album of the Year

* Alabama Shakes, Sound and Color
* Kendrick Lamar, To Pimp a Butterfly
* Chris Stapleton, Traveller
* Taylor Swift, 1989
* The Weeknd, Beauty Behind the Madness

### My Winner: Kendrick Lamar, To Pimp a Butterfly
### Most likely winner: Taylor Swift, 1989

To Pimp a Butterfly is probably my #1 album this year,
and a lot of "top album" lists agree.

The album has some insane talent on it:
Jazz artist Kamashi Washington does a lot of the live instrumentation,
Some of the biggest names in hip hop production are throughout the album 
including Terrace Martin, Flying Lotus, and Pharrel Williams.
The album has a lot of jazz, funk, and soul influence.

The lyrics are personally intimate and offer an interesting
social and political commentary. 

# Record of the Year

### Nominations:

* Uptown Funk, Mark Ronson Featuring Bruno Mars
* Thinking Out Loud, Ed Sheeran
* Really Love, D'Angelo And The Vanguard
* Blank Space, Taylor Swift
* Can't Feel My Face, The Weeknd

### My Winner: Really Love - D'Angelo And The Vanguard
### Most likely winner: Blank Space - Taylor Swift

Nothing in these nominations really screams record (single) of the year.
Even though t-swizzle will probably win, 
I'd love to see D'Angelo get some love.

# Song of the Year

Kendrick Lamar, Alright
Taylor Swift, Blank Space
Little Big Town, Girl Crush
Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth, See You Again
Ed Sheeran, Thinking Out Loud

### My Winner: Kendrick Lamar, Alright
### Most likely winner: Blank Space - Taylor Swift

Not really sure the difference between best record and best song.
However, I'm obviously going to root for Kendrick in anything he's nominated in.
It seems like Taylor Swift is a recurring theme.
I personally think her music is manufactured "safe" poppy music for the masses,
so it'll probably win a lot
Is Wiz Khalifia still relevant though?

# Best Pop Vocal Album

* Kelly Clarkson, Piece by Piece
* Florence + The Machine, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful
* Mark Ronson, Uptown Special
* Taylor Swift, 1989
* James Taylor, Before This World

### My Winner: Florence + The Machine, How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful
### Most likely winner: Taylor Swift, 1989

Florence + The Machine put out an amazing record this year,
and she has so much talent in general. Seriously,
go listen to "What Kind of Man".

# Best Rock Performance

* Alabama Shakes, Don't Wanna Fight
* Florence + The Machine, What Kind Of Man 
* Foo Fighters, Something From Nothing
* Elle King, Ex's & Oh's
* Wolf Alice, Moaning Lisa Smile

### My Winner: Florence + The Machine, What Kind of Man
### Runner Up: Alabama Shakes, Don't Wanna Fight

Both artists put out awesome albums
I'd love to see either win

# Best Alternative Music Album

* Alabama Shakes, Sound & Color
* BjÃ¶rk, Vulnicura
* My Morning Jacket, The Waterfall
* Tame Impala, Currents
* Wilco, Star Wars

### My Winner: Tame Impala, Currents

I'm kind of conflicted with this one because there is actually
a lot of talent on this list.

Bjork probably deserved a Grammy the most,
but Currents was the only album on the list that really
commended my attention.


# Aside: Best Urban Contemporary Album

Not really sure what this category even means.
Sounds racist.

# Best Rap Album

* J. Cole, 2014 Forest Hills Drive
* Dr. Dre, Compton
* Drake, If Youre Reading This Its Too Late
* Kendrick Lamar, To Pimp a Butterfly
* Nicki Minaj, The Pinkprint

### My Winner: Kendrick Lamar, To Pimp a Butterfly
### Runner Up: J Cole, 2014 Forrest Hills Drive

Forrest Hills Drive is an awesome album.
J Cole self produced the album with **no features**. 
However, Kendrick Lamar one-upped everyone with his album.
I'm think after hearing it, Kanye pretty much scrapped
the album he was working on.

Drake will probably win because his music is the most accessible and popular.
There's a few good songs on the album but its literally a mixtape he made
people pay for...

The fact that Nicki Minaj is even in this category is pretty tragic.

# Best Jazz...Anything

I don't care about any of the Jazz nominations because
Kamashi Washington's "The Epic" isn't in ANY of them
and that album is truly **epic** beyond words.

# Best Dance/Electronic Album

* Caribou, Our Love
* The Chemical Brothers, Born in the Echoes
* Disclosure, Caracal
* Jamie XX, In Colour
* Skrillex and Diplo, Skrillex and Diplo Present Jack Ã

### My Winner: Jamie XX, In Colour
### Runner Up: The Chemical Brothers, Born in the Echoes

This is probably the hardest category for me to decide.
I really enjoyed the Caribou, The Chemical Brothers, and Jamie XX albums.
Each has a pretty distinct vibe. In Colour is probably my most-played album
this year, so I'm going to go with that one.

# Best Metal Performance

* August Burns Red, Identity
* Cirice, Ghost
* Lamb of God, 512
* Sevendust, Thank You
* Slipknot, Custer

### My Winner: August Burns Red, Identity
The Grammys really don't understand metal though.


# Best Rock Album

* James Bay, Chaos and the Calm
* Death Cab for Cutie, Kintsugi
* Highly Suspect, Mister Asylum
* Muse, Drones
* Slipknot, .5: The Gray Chapter

### My Winner: None of these

These are all pretty much goose eggs.
Sure I enjoy death cab from time to time,
but is it really best rock album?

# Best Rap Performance

* J. Cole, Apparently
* Drake, Back to Back
* Fetty Wap, Trap Queen
* Kendrick Lamar, Alright
* Nicki Minaj feat. Drake & Lil Wayne, Truffle Butter
* Kanye West feat. Theophilus London, Allan Kingdom & Paul McCartney, All Day

### My Winner: Kanye West, All Day
### Runner Up: Drake, Back to Back

Trap Queen and Truffle Butter shouldn't be in this list next to
some REALLY AWESOME songs.

If you haven't seen Kanye perform All Day live, you probably should do that.
I bet Taylor Swift would say its the best rap performance.
That being said, Drake's Back to Back is really something special.
He completely destroys Meek Mill in it.


# Best Rap/Sung Collaboration

* Big Sean feat. Kanye West & John Legend, One Man Can Change the World
* Common & John Legend, Glory
* Jidenna feat. Roman GianArthur, Classic Man
* Kendrick Lamar feat. Bilal, Anna Wise & Thundercat, These Walls
* Nicki Minaj feat. Drake, Lil Wayne & Chris Brown, Only

### My Winner: Big Sean feat. Kanye West & John Legend, One Man Can Change the World

We all know Big Sean isn't going to win though

# Best Rap Song

* Kanye West feat. Theophilus London, Allan Kingdom & Paul McCartney, All Day
* Kendrick Lamar, Alright
* Drake, Energy
* Common & John Legend, Glory
* Fetty Wap, Trap Queen

### My Winner: Kendirck Lamar, Alright

Please for the love of all the gods,
DON'T PICK TRAP QUEEN
