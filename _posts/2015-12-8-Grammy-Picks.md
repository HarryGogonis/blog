Here are a few of my picks for the 2016 Grammys

# Record of the Year

Nominations:

* Uptown Funk - Mark Ronson Featuring Bruno Mars
* Thinking Out Loud - Ed Sheeran
* Really Love - D'Angelo And The Vanguard
* Blank Space - Taylor Swift
* Can't Feel My Face - The Weeknd

## Really Love - D'Angelo And The Vanguard

Nothing in these nominations really screams record (single) of the year.
Even though t-swizzle will probably win, 
i'd love to see D'Angelo get some love.
